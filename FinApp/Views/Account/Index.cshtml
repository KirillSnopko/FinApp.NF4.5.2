This application is being developed as my own tool to control and analyze my family's money transactions.
 I agree, there are many such applications, but if I can create one, then why not?
After registration, you will be able to create, edit and delete deposits and loans.
 Also, this web application records every financial transaction in a history, after which you can view transactions and statistical charts.
